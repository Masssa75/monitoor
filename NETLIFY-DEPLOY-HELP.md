# Netlify Deployment Help

## Finding Your Netlify URL

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. You should see your MONITOOR site in the dashboard
3. The URL will be shown there (it might be something like `amazing-newton-123abc.netlify.app`)

## Checking Build Status

1. Click on your site in Netlify dashboard
2. Go to "Deploys" tab
3. Check the latest deploy - it will show:
   - ‚úÖ Published (if successful)
   - ‚ùå Failed (if there was an error)
   - üîÑ Building (if still in progress)

## If Build Failed Again

The postcss dependency has been added. If it still fails, the issue might be:

1. **Module resolution**: The `@/lib/supabase/client` import paths
2. **Missing dependencies**: Other packages might be needed

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Option 1: Update imports (if module resolution fails)
Change all imports from:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
```
To:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '../../lib/supabase/client'  // Adjust ../ based on file location
```

### Option 2: Check Netlify Environment Variables
Make sure you added all 4 environment variables in Netlify:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NODE_VERSION` (set to 18)

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Retry
In Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Clear cache and deploy site"
